// Here we are selecting a precisely version of the BOX.
vagrant box add laravel/homestead --box-version 8.1.0

// After press enter, will appear few options to choose. Pick up the one you have instaled on your machine.. ( Usually VIRTUAL BOX )


// At this point we need to have installed COMPOSER if we donÂ´t have it, install it.

// Now use the command:
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel nameOfTheProject // change to the name of you choice.

cd nameOfTheProject
composer require laravel/homestead --dev
